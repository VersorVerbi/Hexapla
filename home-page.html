    In the early third century <em>anno Domini</em>, a controversial scholar named Origen, originally of Alexandria,
    was ordained a priest and named the chief theologian in Caesarea (in modern-day Israel). He founded a catechetical
    school there, and compiled his most influential work: the Hexapla.
</div>
<div>
    <em>Hexapla</em> means <em>six-fold</em>. The name referred to the six columns found in the codex. The first column
    was the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, which Origen had purchased on a visit to Jericho. The second column was
    the <em>Secunda</em> ("following"), which was the Hebrew Bible transliterated into Greek (Hebrew words written with
    Greek letters). The third column was Aquila of Sinope's Greek translation of the Old Testament (mid-second century
    AD). The fourth column was Symmachus the Ebionite's Greek translation from the late second century. The fifth column
    was a copy of the Greek Septuagint ("Seventy" or LXX, for its seventy Jewish translators in the second century BC,
    about 400 years earlier than the other Greek versions) to which Origen had added critical annotations indicating
    both where the Septuagint was missing content from the Hebrew text and where it had added content that did not
    reflect the Hebrew. The sixth and final column was the Greek translation of Theodotion (also from the second century
    AD).

<div>
    Origen's work was foundational because it treated the text as a document that needed scholarly evaluation. The habit
    of comparing translations in an effort to get the most reliable version of the text began with Origen. It is that
    effort that we seek to support here at <strong>Modern Hexapla</strong>.

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<div>
    Use the <em>configuration</em> button (<span class="icofont-gear-alt"></span>) to control which translations you
    want to see (at least one and no more than 6). Then use the search bar to look up a passage.
</div>
<div>
    Once you're comparing passages, you can use the <em>show differences</em> button (<span class="icofont-opposite"></span>)
    to do what Origen did and point out where the translations you're comparing differ.
</div>
<div>
    If you find something you want to share (or bookmark), click the <em>permalink</em> button (<span class="icofont-link"></span>)
    to reload the page with a URL that will always generate the same view. That URL will also be copied to your clipboard
    for you, so you don't have to do those extra clicks.
</div>
<div>
    More features and settings are handled in the <em>menu</em>
    <span class="keep-together">(<span class="menu-example icon-example"></span>)</span>. If you click on a word, the
    definition will be loaded into the <em>dictionary</em>
    <span class="keep-together">(<span class="dict-example icon-example"></span>)</span> and other places the word is
    used (based on the Strong's number if we have it, or based on the literal word if we don't) will be loaded into
    <em>cross-references</em> <span class="keep-together">(<span class="ref-example icon-example"></span>)</span>.
